## Seeker of knowledge, tryer of new technologies ðŸ”®
ðŸ‘‹ Hey, what's up. Welcome to my Github Profile!

Here, I publish code that I work on for personal projects as well as mini-projects that I use as learning opportunities. 

Some things that I am interested in are:
* ðŸ§  Machine Learning
* ðŸ’» Computer Architecture
* ðŸ’¹ Statistical Analysis
* ðŸ§° Messing with Linux: See my [dotfiles](https://github.com/Isaac-To/dotfiles) for more
* and many other things

Also, I highly encourage you to check out my blog at [sfisaact.com](https://sfisaact.com/) in which I document a lot of the things that I am working on as of late or just things that I learn in general.
